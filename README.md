<p align="center">Introduction</p>

The RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM is an easy ticket booking system for busy travelers. 
Creating a system like this will save many passengers their valuable time. Nowadays, many 
people have to wait in line if they want to travel by Sri Lanka Railways. Because of this, 
emergency passengers are more likely to miss the train. But if such a system is created and is 
operational within the Department of Railways, many will be able to book train tickets in 
advance so they do not have to wait in queues. If you have to wait in line or get a ticket and 
have to go through a lot of traffic without a seat on the train, it can be very inconvenient for 
passengers, especially foreign passengers. Many foreign tourists prefer to travel by train. If 
foreign tourists cannot afford a quality service by train, is there any use in their travels? We 
have also seen foreigners often traveling in overcrowded trains. Do they come to Sri Lanka to 
face such difficulties? Also, the locals are subjected to these severe difficulties. The department 
is still printing and issuing train tickets, so extra money has to be spent. The inability to provide 
an efficient service is another major problem faced by the Railway Department.
