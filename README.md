Introduction
The RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM is an easy ticket booking system for busy travelers. 
Creating a system like this will save many passengers their valuable time. Nowadays, many 
people have to wait in line if they want to travel by Sri Lanka Railways. Because of this, 
emergency passengers are more likely to miss the train. But if such a system is created and is 
operational within the Department of Railways, many will be able to book train tickets in 
advance so they do not have to wait in queues. If you have to wait in line or get a ticket and 
have to go through a lot of traffic without a seat on the train, it can be very inconvenient for 
passengers, especially foreign passengers. Many foreign tourists prefer to travel by train. If 
foreign tourists cannot afford a quality service by train, is there any use in their travels? We 
have also seen foreigners often traveling in overcrowded trains. Do they come to Sri Lanka to 
face such difficulties? Also, the locals are subjected to these severe difficulties. The department 
is still printing and issuing train tickets, so extra money has to be spent. The inability to provide 
an efficient service is another major problem faced by the Railway Department.

User Specification
The Railway Ticket Reservation System requires a login before the user can use it. Email and 
password are used for that. The user must be registered before logging in. You must provide 
name, email, date of birth, gender, mobile number, address, password when registering.
After logging in, the user can view the train schedule and the number of seats left on each train. 
Trains without seats cannot be reserved. Users can provide their details and book a ticket for 
the relevant train. For that the user should provide the following information. Train start and 
destination, date and time, number of adults and number of children. You can then pay for the 
ticket. Credit card information must be provided to make the payment.
After payment the user can view the ticket after the admin confirms it. The admin can also 
cancel the request if the user does not provide the correct information. The user can cancel a 
ticket, but it must be done within a certain period of time

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
